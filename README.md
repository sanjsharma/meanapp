# meanapp
This is my first MEAN stack application without using MEAN.io i.e. I'll be combining each element of MEAN MongoDb, Express, Angular and Node from scratch. P.S. MEAN.io does it for you before hand :)

Dependencies of this applications are:
npm
bower 
grunt 
express
mongoose
angular 
yoeman 
compass 


1) CLone the app

2) install monogo db in your computer 

3) install npm 

4) npm install -g bower

5) npm install -g grunt-cli

6) npm install -g yo

7) cd meanapp/server 

8) npm install

9) run 'node index.js', this should show server responding on port 3000 


10) cd meanapp/client

11) npm install

12) bower install

13) grunt serve , which should open localhost:9000 in your browser

14) Enjoy your CRUD movie MEAN application. Cheers !!!
